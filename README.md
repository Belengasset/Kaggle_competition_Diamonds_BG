![PORTADA](images/PORTADA.jpg)

## OBJECTIVE
---
Find the best machine learning model and params for a given dataset.

Find the Kaggle competition with your cohort name, i.e. diamonds-datamad1022-part, link here

## Folders
----
[Data](https://github.com/Belengasset/Dashboard_project_BG/tree/main/Data): *Contains the csv's with the data, the `train.csv`, `test.csv` and the `sample submission`*


[Notebook](https://github.com/Belengasset/Dashboard_project_BG/tree/main/Notebook): *It's divided in submission folders. Each folder contains the files (Jupyter notebooks) where the code is and the `csv` generated for the submission.*

[Images](https://github.com/Belengasset/Dashboard_project_BG/tree/main/Images): *Contains the files (images) to insert in the jupyters*

## Libraries
----

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): library is used for data analysis and manipulation
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): library is used for numerical operations
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): library is used for data visualization, including creating various types of plots such as scatterplots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, heatmaps, and more.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): library is used for data visualization, including creating various types of plots such as scatterplots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, histograms, and more.
- [Scipy](https://scipy.org/): library is used for scientific computing, including optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, and more.
- [Warnings](): warnings are messages that are generated to indicate that something unexpected has occurred, but the program can continue running.
- [Scikit-learn](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html): library is used for machine learning, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation. The provided algorithms include regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.

This work has allowed me to improve my programming skills, to put into practice what has been learned in machine learning and more importantly learn to discern and filter what is relevant.
